# predix-eclipse-preferences

Interested in using the Eclipse errors/warnings and formatting that the Predix team uses in all it's sample code?

Also, we have a Predix Eclipse dictionary with some common words you see in the Predix universe so your JavaDocs and other documentation when viewing in Eclipse does not print warnings.

##Install the Preferences

1. Open Eclipse
2. From the File menu, choose Import
3. Select the option for General Preferences
4. Browse to the downloaded predixPrefs.epf file
5. Click Finish
6a. To activate the formatting in particular, choose the Window menu, then Preferences
6b. Navigate on the left to Java / Code Style / Formatter
6c. Click the Edit button on Active Profile
6d. Click Ok
6e. Click Apply
6f. Click Ok.

Notice that your 'Markers' view now shows more Errors and Warning.
To Format a MyClass.java file, press Ctrl-Shift-F and it will format the page to have line breaks at 120 characters wide.  This is very helpful to have consistent formatting of files across the team.

##Install the Eclipse Dictionary

1. Open Eclipse
2. Choose the Window menu, then Preferences
3. Navigate on the left to General / Editors / Text Editors / Spelling 
4. Next to the User Defined Dictionary textbox and click the Browse button to choose the downloaded eclipse_dictionary file.

Now notice the code has fewer warnings when checking for Spelling of things like 'Predix'.
